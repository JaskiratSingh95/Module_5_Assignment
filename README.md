### Analysis by Jaskirat Singh  The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. The study was done on 21 month old mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumours who received the following drug regimens:
1) Capomulin (Pymaceutical drug of interest)
2) Ceftamin 
3) Infubinol 
4) Ketapril 
5) Naftisol 
6) Placebo 
7) Propriva 
8) Ramicane 
9) Stelasyn	
10) Zoniferol
The study included 249 mice (125 male 124 female) which were studied upto the timepoints ranging untill 45 days. The data was cleaned to remove duplicate mouse Ids from the dataset. Capomulin has a mean tumor volume of 40.68 and a variance of 24.95 and a standard deviation of 4.99 and SEM of 0.33 the profile is similar to the drug regimen Ramicane (mean = 40.22, Variance 23.48, standard deviation 4.85 and SEM of 0.32). All other drug regimen are performing at a much less efficient level. this is also evident from the bar plot (see bar plot). The drug of interest, Capomulin has no outliers. 

The scatter plot of Mouse Weight vs. Average Tumor Volume for Capomulin Regimen shows us that mice with higher weight have shown to possess hgher tumour volumes. The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is: 0.87 which shows that the relation is strongly correlated.
